"It is never too late to be what you might have been." — George Eliot

My name is Guillermo Trenor, and I am a data scientist specializing in Python. After completing my studies in Industrial Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in mathematics, I began working as a continuous improvement engineer in production environments. Although I achieved the goals set in my roles, I felt that I wasn’t fully tapping into my potential. The stagnation in the development of my professional skills consumed me.

I decided to make a major shift in my career and return to one of the areas of my studies that had always intrigued me. Alongside my admiration for statistics, where everything is a game of probabilities, I found early success in programming while working on projects during my master’s degree. For that reason, I decided to steer my career toward data science, a field where there will always be something new to learn—whether from a technical perspective or in applying it to new domains. And so far, that has been the case. To make this transition, I completed an international bootcamp conducted entirely in English. This was the first stone in building a snowball of continuous growth.

In this portfolio, I share some of the projects that reflect my progress and passion for the field, each contributing to my ongoing development.
